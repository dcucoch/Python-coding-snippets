      "question": "Water",
      "answer": "Water related dreams can mean you feel overwhelmed or unsupported by your loved ones. A dream about water can mean various things but mainly it symbolises being either trapped or free. The meaning depends on what you link with water in your day to day life. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large amount of water it can mean that you have deep emotions or a strong emotional reaction to something happening in your life right now."

    {
      "question": "Vehicles",
      "answer": "To dream about a vehicle tends to mean nothing in particular, HOWEVER if you dream about something like a car crash or accident, it means you have low confidence. This type of dream should be paid more attention to as it symbolises emotional stress or a bad mental state. If you dream about a car crash it can actually meant hat you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about losing something like a job, relationship or even your house, so you need to find the source of that worry. Work out why you're worried about that thing, and then fix it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Being trapped",
      "answer": "To dream about being trapped tends to mean you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just worried about your current situation. This can mean your job, relationship or even which country you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in. Your mind tends to show you things in a subtle way, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about your job holding you back from traveling for example, your brain might create a dream in which you're trapped. A dream about being trapped in a small space usually means you're just not happy with where you are and you want to change your current situation. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not many cases where dreaming about being trapped is a good thing, so be careful with this one!"

      "question": "Teeth falling out",
      "answer": "The teeth falling out dream (or I should say nightmare!) is a VERY common dream that people have. Almost everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a dream about their teeth falling out at one point in their lives, and probably wondered what it means. Turns out this dream is very common because when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re young and we lose our teeth for the first time (our milk teeth to make way for the real ones), we're scared. I remember being terrified of what was happening to me when my teeth started falling out, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually the first REALLY traumatic or scary thing we experience as young people."

    {
      "question": "Babies",
      "answer": "To dream about babies just means you want to continue and grow your family and create a legacy. IT means you want to be a father or mother figure in your childrens lives and make the world a better place. The other side of this dream however, could be that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re holding something back. Dreaming about children can also mean that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wanting to develop your relationship with your own inner child. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said that everyone has an inner child or true self that is itching to be released and freed. This sometimes manifests in the form of dreams."
    },
    {
      "question": "Animals",
      "answer": "A dream about animals is almost always about an aspect of yourself. Animals are so easy to link to a personality trait or emotion, for example you might link a snake to someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deceptive or dishonest. You might link a lion to someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong, courageous and powerful. So to dream about a specific animal is usually fairly easy to analyse. Sometimes the actual animals we dream about can just mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking about our own behaviour in the waking world."

    {
      "question": "Being chased",
      "answer": "Usually its not anything in particular but just the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfeeling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being chased, and so you run and run. In the dream of course, running and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpushing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 your leg muscles to run faster does nothing but slow you down, just like trying to fly. Now, this is an interesting one because it could just be that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen too many horror films and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re scared of someone chasing you. Chase scenes are VERY common in horror films, and you might just be reliving it because you just saw a film. It can also however, mean that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about an issue that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve no resolved. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re leaving that work you KNOW you need to do for next week, to dream about being chased is like your brain saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccome on, pay attention to this issue now\u00e2\u20ac\u2122."
    },
    {
      "question": "Death or dying",
      "answer": "A dream about death can actually just mean you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accepting that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re changing into someone else. When we change, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said that we die a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmall death\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, meaning a part of who we WERE dies and makes way for the person we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re becoming."
    },
    {
      "question": "Religious symbols",
      "answer": "Usually you only dream about a cross if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very much in the world that recognises them. The cross is traditionally a Christian symbol meaning the death and rebirth of Christ. This means for the most part, only religious people will dream about crosses, because they see them every day as they look through their church, bible etc. In other parts of the world however, this can mean different things so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth doing a bit of research to find out what this means for you. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a Christian and you keep dreaming about crosses, it could mean something different. For some parts of the world, it can mean trouble or dangerous times ahead."
    },
    {
      "question": "Taking exams",
      "answer": "This type of dream can just mean that you're being put to the test in waking life, or you feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being judged by the people around you. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have be be a bad thing, and sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just your brain saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being watched by people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It can also literally mean that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about taking your exams though, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in school! But for adults who have long since passed their exams, it usually just means that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about what others will think of you, or how you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll perform in some big event that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming up."
